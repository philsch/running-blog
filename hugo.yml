      I've been running for a while now, but only realized recently that the world's *most accessible* sport
      isn't as easy as it seems. Developing a good running and workout routine requires a lot of knowledge and, ideally, 
      prevents injuries before they occur. This page will serve as my *living notebook*: My second brain for keeping track
      of good habits and taking notes whenever I read something interesting ...<br/><br/>
      All posts will have a *Suggest Changes* link, so I invite you to contribute with your experience and knowledge 
      if you like.<br/><br/>
      Happy running!
