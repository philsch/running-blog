Whether you are just starting your running journey or getting back into running after a long break, this post is for you.

We live in an amazing time: High-end running gear, participation in official races is at an all-time high and there are hundreds
of virtual or real-life running groups out there. This can be motivating and a little "peer pressure" can help you stick to your 
routine when it's dark and rainy outside or push you out of your comfort zone for that extra mile. But sometimes we just 
feel overwhelmed or maybe there is too much pressure to keep up because "it looks so much easier" for the others, right?

It's important to remember that we all have a different training backgrounds. Of course a 10k run looks easy to someone 
who does it 3-times a week, but it's a different story if that person would instantly run a marathon (hint: don't do it :sweat_smile: ). 
Similarly, you shouldn't run every day for "some challenge" if you've just started running and your body is not used
to it.

So the first **golden rule** for you should be:

> Use others as motivation and inspiration, but your benchmark should always be your past self:
> Are you better than you were a week, month or year ago?

The upcoming basic rules should give you a guideline to avoid some beginners mistakes.

### The basic rules

* :pray: Most important: Sore muscles and (chronic) pain are significantly different! If you have any pre-existing medical conditions, injuries, or concerns regarding your health and fitness level, always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new exercise program
* :hatching_chick: Special advice for beginners or comeback after a longer break
  * Start slowly so your body can adapt
  * It's perfectly fine to walk in between, if you can't speak two sentences out loud anymore you're overdoing it!
  * Max of 2-3 runs per week in the first weeks / months (depending on how you feel)
  * If you start with a running group: have at least one other run per week in addition - if the group is fast for you, then that is your intense run and you choose a slower pace or shorter distance for your personal run (or vice versa)
  * Less km per run and an additional run on another day is better than just one long run
* :rocket: Increase speed **or** distance no more than 5-10% per week, do not increase both at the same time
* :fish_cake: Vary between different exercise types like intervals, speed trainings, playful running ("let's sprint to the next tree") and slow long-distances
* :snail: Slow runs and enough recovery time will make you faster - if you had 3 intense weeks, have 1 week without speed training and less distance
* :running_shoe: Don't buy your running shoes online. Find a store where you can try on different models and choose the one that feels best (and not by color or brand)
* :sleeping: Your body may need more rest than usual (especially in the winter) to recover, try to get 8h+ of good sleep from time to time
* :see_no_evil: Skipping one training is ok, but then never miss the next one (only exception is sickness)
